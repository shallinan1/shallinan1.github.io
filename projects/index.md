**Earthquake Tests**

  This is a paper written about an experiment I conducted in high school.
Using Jenga blocks as a model, I varied the amount of floors or stories to see
how a fixed amount of force would affect the time it took the building to fall down.
  In addition to conucting this experiment, I wrote a statistical anaylsis that
examines the data that I collected, and utilizes methods such as ANOVA and two sample t-tests.
All data analysis was done in RStudio.

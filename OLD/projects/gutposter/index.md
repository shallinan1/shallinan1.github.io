# Poster: Cospeciation of Gut Hominids with Hominids

  This is a poster I created for my Writing in the Natural Sciences english course.
I had to summarize and display the results of the paper, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995445/pdf/nihms-810775.pdf" target="_blank">Gut Microbiome Paper (.pdf)</a>
I read the original paper, reworded the information for a presentation format, and created the following poster.

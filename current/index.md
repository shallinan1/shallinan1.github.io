<font size="5">I'm currently working analyzing my sleep and activity data for the winter quarter of 2018  
in Rstudio. If you want to do your own analysis, [**<font color="green">here</font>**](/assets/data/sleepcsv.csv) is the sleep data and [**<font color="green">here</font>**](/assets/data/activitycsv.csv) is the activity data.  
They are both in csv form and I have cleaned up the data a bit. Feel free to share your own anaylsis and/or results with me!

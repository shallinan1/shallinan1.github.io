			<h1>Current</h1>
			<p><font size = 1.5em> I'm currently working analyzing my sleep and activity data for the winter quarter of 2018<br>
in Rstudio. If you want to do your own analysis, <a href="/assets/data/sleepcsv.csv"><b><font color="green">here</font></b></a> is the sleep data 
and <a href="/assets/data/activitycsv.csv"><b><font color="green">here</font></b></a> is the activity data.<br>
      They are both in csv form and I have cleaned up the data a bit.
      Feel free to share your own anaylsis and/or results with me! <br> </p>

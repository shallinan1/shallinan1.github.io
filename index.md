I am happy to anounce that I will be working on volunteer undergraduate research at the Dey Lab in Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center this quarter, with an emphasis on the gut microbiome, and computational modeling.
In addition, I will be working at the Yager Lab at the University of Washington this summer, with a focus on the design and clinical testing of microfluidic devices. 

In addition to this research, I will be taking CSE 143, CHEM 237, MATH 300 this summer.
In the fall, I will be taking CHEM 238, CHEM 241, AMATH 352, and PHYS 122

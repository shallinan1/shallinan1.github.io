I am a freshman at the University of Washington. Although I plan to major in bioengineering and applied math,
there are many other topics that I love learning about, like statistics and psychology. In general, I love learning
new information, and love taking classes at the University of Washington.

Outside of classes, my hobbies include running, playing/watching basketball, and drinking tea. 



Areas of Interest: Statistics

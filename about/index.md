I am a rising sophomore at the University of Washington. I plan to major in bioengineering and applied math.
Outside of these, I am interested in broader scientific topics like statistics and psychology. In general, I love learning
new information, and love exploring my interests through my coursework.

Outside of classes, my hobbies include running, playing/watching basketball, and drinking tea.
